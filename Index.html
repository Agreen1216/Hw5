                <p>
                    I was born on December 16
                    <sup>th</sup>, 1991.
                    <br />I love sports and anything related to them, especially football which is my first love.
                    Speaking of which I am a <b> DIE HARD</b> Dallas Cowboys fan.
                    <br />I am firm belevier that Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliot will lead us to the promised land which is a 6
                    <sup>th</sup> super bowl ring
                    <br /> I was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, so I am
                    <del>used</del>

                    My girlfriend Brandee and I have been together for 3 and half years. We met through a mutual friend and
                    fireworks have not stopped! We have 1 baby girl named Janet who can only be described as my headache.
                </p>

                <p>Reasons why I call her my headache</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She loves playing on Daddy's iphone</li>
                    <li>She is apparently allergic to a clean house</li>
                    <li>
                        Any and all food must be placed on the floor
                        <ul>
                            <li>and on the wall</li>
                            <li>and in her hair</li>
                            <li>and on the dog...you get the idea</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>she has a love for ripping papers that daddy carelessly lays around the house</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I hope to accomplish</h2>

                <p>
                    I would like to provide for my family on a cosistent basis. For as long as I can remember one of my worst fears is lack of job security. 
                    I also would love to actually work for a company who values me and my opinions, and does not see me as just another face that makes them money. 
                    The tech field is a growing one and to finally become apart of it would be a dream come true.
